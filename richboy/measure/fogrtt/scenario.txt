In this application, we are sending data from the devices to the fog. The fog offloads the data to another another
application to do machine learning which then returns the result to the original application.
The application broadcasts the trained neural network information back to the device for faster prediction.
In this example however, the broadcast stops at the device J because the network data is only readable in Javascript.
Since the device J and the device C and basically on physical device (in this case), we can argue that communication
time is negligible.
